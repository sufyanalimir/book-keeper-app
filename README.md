# book-keeper-app

Hello Folks,
This app is designed to allow it's users to save bookmarks and be able to click on the links to go to those websites.
It also has local storage functionality, meaning that a user can come back to the our app any time and find bookmarks just as they left them.
Have a look over it and if you find any issues please let me know.

Thank you for being here.
